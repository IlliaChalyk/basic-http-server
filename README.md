## About:

That is a study project and not for use in actual production projects.
This HTTP server utilizes the functionality of the java.net package and is written purely on Java.

### Plans:

- wrap java.net classes with own API
- develop an API for request handlers (like servlets)
- develop an API to easily extend server functionality e.g. add security module

### TODOs:
- add license to this project
- fill readme with useful info
- what http version it supports
- how to use it
- link to docs
